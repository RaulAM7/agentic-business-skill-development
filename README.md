# Agentic Business Skill Development

A learning-by-building repository for developing competence with agentic systems, prompt engineering, and business automation.

This is **not** a single project—it's a skill-development operating system. Each phase builds foundational knowledge and practical patterns that transfer across use cases.

## What You'll Build

- **Agents** — Multi-step reasoning and orchestration patterns
- **Prompts** — Effective prompt engineering templates
- **Skills** — Reusable modules for common business tasks
- **Systems** — Integrations and business OS patterns

## Learning Phases

1. **Foundations** (01-foundations) — Core concepts, basic agent patterns, prompt structure, foundational exercises
2. **Skills and Orchestration** (02-skills-and-orchestration) — Multi-agent systems, skill composition, workflows
3. **MCP and Browser Automation** (03-mcp-and-browser-automation) — Model context protocol, browser interactions, advanced integrations
4. **Business OS** (04-business-os) — Systems thinking, integration patterns, business automation
5. **Optimization and Local Models** (05-optimization-and-local-models) — Performance tuning, cost optimization, local model deployment
