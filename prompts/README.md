# Prompts

Prompt templates and engineering patterns for specific tasks.

Each prompt should be modular and reusable. Include:
- Clear task description
- Variables and placeholders
- Expected input/output format
- Variations for different use cases

Prompts are extracted from agent implementations and learning exercises.
