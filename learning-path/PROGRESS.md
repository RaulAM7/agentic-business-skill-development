## Notes

- **Phase 01 completeness:** 8/8 core lessons (Module 1) complete. 5/5 Module 2 complete. Five key-learning documents complete.
- **In-progress items:** crash-course-claude-code tracked. crash-course-antigravity (issue #13) and mini-projects (issue #14) in development.
- **Future phases:** Phases 02-05 curriculum definition in progress (issues #16-19 open, status: ready).
- **Extraction rate:** itinerary-pm agent extracted and operational. Additional agents/prompts/skills pending.

**Update protocol:**
- Check a box when you complete a learning unit (not before)
- Run itinerary-pm agent to sync with GitHub
- Agent will propose and execute corresponding changes to GitHub Issues
- Update this file's "Last Updated" timestamp when manual changes are made
