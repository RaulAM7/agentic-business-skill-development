## Sync Status

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-08
**GitHub Sync Status:** Initializing
**Outstanding Sync Tasks:**
- [ ] Create GitHub labels (phase, type, status)
- [ ] Create GitHub milestones (Phase 01-05)
- [ ] Create issues from unchecked items
- [ ] Establish bidirectional sync protocol

## Notes

- **Phase 01 completeness:** 8/8 core lessons (Module 1) complete. Module 2 partial (3/5). Five key-learning documents complete.
- **Blocked items:** crash-course-antigravity and mini-projects awaiting curriculum definition (status: blocked)
- **Future phases:** Phases 02-05 are currently placeholders. Curriculum definition is blocking all content development.
- **Extraction rate:** No agents/prompts/skills extracted yet. Pending system setup and learning completion.

**Update protocol:**
- Check a box when you complete a learning unit (not before)
- Run itinerary-pm agent to sync with GitHub
- Agent will propose and execute corresponding changes to GitHub Issues
- Update this file's "Last Updated" timestamp when manual changes are made
