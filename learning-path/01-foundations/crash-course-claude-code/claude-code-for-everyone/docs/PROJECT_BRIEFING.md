# Basecamp Coffee - Coffee Personality Quiz Project Briefing

## Quick Start

**What this is:** A personality-first loyalty program redesign to save Basecamp's failing rewards system. You're building a Coffee Personality Quiz that helps customers discover their coffee identity and creates authentic engagement.

**Why it matters:** $40K invested, 3-month deadline, 83% inactive members, negative ROI. This is the turnaround solution based on explicit customer feedback and competitive gap analysis.

**Current status:** Concept validated, building MVP prototype.

## Financial Context

**Investment to date:** $40,000 in loyalty program infrastructure
**Remaining budget:** $8,000 for Coffee Personality Quiz MVP
**Timeline:** 3 months to demonstrate viability or program gets killed
**Break-even target:** 1.8x ROI (return to January baseline)
**Current economics:** 0.5x ROI, losing money per member

**Cost structure:**
- Quiz development: $3,000 (MVP prototype)
- Marketing launch: $2,500 (in-store materials, digital)
- Technical integration: $1,500 (POS/app connection)
- Reserve: $1,000 (iteration budget)

**Success threshold:** Demonstrate positive unit economics by Week 8 or pivot.

## Project Overview

**Problem:** Generic loyalty program with no identity, personalization, or belonging. Members sign up (122% growth) but don't engage (60% decline in active users). Program NPS dropped from 34 to 12 while brand NPS remains 67. Customers love the coffee, hate the rewards.

**Root cause:** Every failed campaign assumed "engagement = more transactions" and tried to buy behavior with extrinsic rewards. Competitors win by creating identity, belonging, and discovery.

**Solution:** Coffee Personality Quiz - systematic personality discovery that creates intrinsic motivation, authentic belonging, and barista-enabled personalization.

**Why this wins:**
- Addresses explicit customer feedback: "What if you helped people discover their coffee personality?" (mentioned 3x independently in research)
- Fills unmet competitive gap (no competitor owns personality-first loyalty)
- Leverages existing barista relationships and community positioning
- Creates authentic sharing (unlike failed Campaign 9 social incentive)
- Simplifies value proposition vs. complex tier system

**Core mechanics:**
1. Quick quiz assigns coffee personality type (e.g., Bold Adventurer, Smooth Ritualist)
2. Personality drives personalized seasonal recommendations
3. Barista app shows personality before interaction
4. Visible identity markers (badge/card) create belonging
5. Personality-based community features and voting

## Go-to-Market & Execution Plan

**Phase 1: Soft Launch (Weeks 1-2)**
- Deploy quiz to 3 pilot stores (Seattle downtown, Portland Pearl, Boise downtown)
- Barista-assisted signups only (staff trained on value proposition)
- Goal: 100 completions, gather initial feedback
- Budget: $500 (pilot materials)
- Go/No-Go: Completion rate above 40%, qualitative feedback positive

**Phase 2: Store Rollout (Weeks 3-4)**
- Expand to all 45 locations
- In-store signage, barista talking points, table tents
- Digital: Email to existing loyalty members, app push notification
- Goal: 2,500 completions (10% of existing member base)
- Budget: $2,000 (marketing materials, digital)
- Go/No-Go: Completion rate sustained above 50%, 30-day return visits tracking above baseline

**Phase 3: Optimization (Weeks 5-8)**
- A/B test personality types, quiz questions, result presentations
- Implement personality-based seasonal recommendations
- Launch barista recognition program (personality greeting)
- Goal: 30-day retention above 40%, recommendation acceptance above 20%
- Budget: $500 (iteration, materials updates)
- Go/No-Go: CLV improvement visible, unit economics trending positive

**Phase 4: Scale (Weeks 9-12)**
- Full program integration (birthday rewards tied to personality, tier system replaced)
- Community features (personality voting, limited releases)
- Referral mechanism ("What's YOUR coffee personality?")
- Goal: 8,000+ completions (50% of active base), ROI approaching 1.5x
- Budget: $500 (community features, ongoing optimization)

**Marketing channels:**
- Primary: In-store barista facilitation (highest conversion, Campaign 6 proof)
- Secondary: Existing member email (23% engagement on surveys)
- Tertiary: App push (low spam risk if personalized)
- Organic: Shareable results (authentic, not incentivized like Campaign 9 failure)

## Retention & Lifecycle Strategy

**Post-quiz engagement (30-day):**
- Day 0: Quiz completion, personality result with first personalized recommendation
- Day 3: Email with "3 drinks your Bold Adventurer personality will love"
- Day 7: App push for personality-matched seasonal launch
- Day 14: Barista greeting by personality type (if they visit)
- Day 21: Email with personality community feature (vote on next limited release)
- Day 30: Birthday month check (tie birthday reward to personality-based experience)

**Seasonal cadence:**
- Every 6 weeks: New seasonal drink with personality-based marketing
- Quarterly: Personality-based limited release voting (community engagement)
- Annually: Personality progression/refinement option (like Starbucks challenges)

**Retention mechanics:**
- Discovery: Personality-based recommendations create intrinsic motivation to try new items
- Belonging: Visible identity markers and community features
- Recognition: Baristas greet by personality, creating relationship depth
- Progression: Seasonal discovery creates ongoing engagement (not arbitrary points)

## Technical Requirements & Dependencies

**Core dependencies:**
- POS system integration: Personality type must be visible to baristas during transaction
- App infrastructure: Existing loyalty app can host quiz (no rebuild required)
- Data infrastructure: Customer preferences stored and tied to loyalty ID
- Email platform: Mailchimp integration for personality-based campaigns

**Data & privacy requirements:**
- Customer consent: Quiz results and preferences stored, opt-in for personalized marketing
- GDPR/CCPA compliance: Clear data usage policy, deletion on request
- Barista access: View personality type only, not purchase history or personal data
- Analytics: Track quiz completions, recommendation acceptance, visit frequency by personality type

**Technical risks:**
- POS integration delay (mitigation: baristas use app as manual lookup)
- App performance issues (mitigation: lightweight quiz design, minimal data)
- Data sync latency (mitigation: acceptable 5-minute delay for barista recognition)

**Integration points:**
- Loyalty app: Quiz hosted as new feature tab
- POS: API call to display personality badge on order screen
- Email: Mailchimp segments by personality type for campaigns
- Analytics: Priya's dashboard adds quiz completion and personality metrics

## Milestones & Gates

**Week 2 Gate: Pilot Validation**
- Metric: 100+ quiz completions, 40%+ completion rate, positive qualitative feedback
- Decision: Proceed to full rollout OR iterate quiz design
- Failure mode: Low completion signals poor value proposition (investigate quiz length, question clarity)

**Week 4 Gate: Rollout Traction**
- Metric: 2,500+ completions, 50%+ completion rate, baseline 30-day retention holding
- Decision: Proceed to optimization OR pause for diagnosis
- Failure mode: Low adoption signals marketing/positioning problem (investigate in-store materials, barista training)

**Week 8 Gate: Economics Check**
- Metric: 30-day retention above 40%, CLV improvement visible, cost per completion below $6
- Decision: Proceed to scale OR pivot strategy
- Failure mode: Retention not improving signals personality doesn't create stickiness (investigate alternative engagement mechanics)

**Week 12 Gate: Program Viability**
- Metric: 8,000+ completions, ROI trending toward 1.5x, member satisfaction improving
- Decision: Full program integration OR kill loyalty program
- Failure mode: No economic improvement after 3 months signals fundamental program problem (recommend alternative strategy or program sunset)

## Unit Economics

**Cost per quiz completion (target $4):**
- Marketing materials: $0.80 per completion (amortized)
- Barista incentive: $1.25 per completion (at 20:1 ratio)
- Technical overhead: $0.40 per completion (hosting, data)
- Email/push: $0.15 per completion
- Total target: $2.60 per completion (40% margin to target)

**Customer lifetime value (target $47):**
- Baseline LTV: $29 (current failing program)
- Target improvement: +$18 over 90 days
- Mechanism: +1.5 visits/month at $12 average = +$18/month = $54 over 90 days
- Conservative target: +1.0 visits/month = +$36 over 90 days = $65 total LTV

**Payback calculation:**
- Acquisition cost: $12 (existing CAC) + $4 (quiz) = $16 total
- Target incremental margin: $8/month (at +1 visit/month, 66% margin)
- Payback period: 2 months
- 90-day return: $24 incremental margin - $16 cost = $8 net gain = 1.5x ROI

**Break-even scenarios:**
- Best case (40% retention, +1.5 visits): 1.8x ROI by Week 12
- Base case (35% retention, +1.0 visits): 1.5x ROI by Week 12
- Minimum viable (30% retention, +0.75 visits): 1.2x ROI by Week 12
- Failure case (below 30% retention): Negative ROI, kill program

## Competitive Landscape

**Direct competitors:**
- Starbucks Rewards: 34M members, gamification + convenience, owns "insider status"
- Dutch Bros: Cult loyalty through relationships, owns "belonging + energy"
- Peet's: Simple quality positioning, stable but forgettable
- Local independents: Relationship-based, doesn't scale

**Competitive gaps (what nobody owns):**
- Systematic coffee personality discovery at scale
- Personality-driven community (not tier-based)
- Barista-enabled personality recognition (digital + human)
- Authentic identity markers (not transaction-based status)

**Why Basecamp can win here:**
- Existing community positioning (local shop vibe at regional scale)
- Barista relationships (staff want meaningful interactions)
- Customer feedback explicitly requesting this (mentioned 3x in research)
- Mid-market positioning (accessible like Starbucks, authentic like independents)

**Threats:**
- Starbucks copies personality quiz (low risk: doesn't align with convenience positioning)
- Dutch Bros doubles down on relationships (medium risk: baristas already do this manually)
- Program feels gimmicky if poorly executed (high risk: mitigation through authentic design)
