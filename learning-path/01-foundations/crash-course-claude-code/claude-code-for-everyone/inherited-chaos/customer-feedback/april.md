### One Comment That Stuck With Me
> "Your coffee has personality. Your rewards program doesn't. Fix that and you'd have something."

## Summary
April was rough. The gap between how people feel about Basecamp (positive) and how they feel about Basecamp Rewards (meh) is getting more obvious. People want something that feels like US, not like a generic points program. The phrase "fine but forgettable" has now appeared in 3 different months of feedback. That's our problem in three words.
