# Campaign: Seasonal Drink Launch Points

**Status:** Ran once, okay results
**Last Run:** March (Spring menu launch)

## Concept
Bonus points for trying new seasonal drinks to drive trial.

## Details
- 2x points on seasonal drink purchases
- First week of seasonal menu only
- Promoted via email + in-store signage

## Results
- 31% of members tried at least one seasonal drink (up from typical 22%)
- But only 12% came back for the same drink again
- Points bonus cost: ~$800
- Some nice social media content from excited customers

## What Happened
Got people to try something new, which is good. But the points weren't the reason - the NEW DRINK was the reason. We probably would have gotten similar trial without the points bonus.

## Assessment
Seasonal drinks already have built-in excitement. Points didn't add much value. The real opportunity is helping people discover drinks they'll LOVE and come back for, not just try once.

## Notes
- What if we recommended seasonal drinks based on preferences?
- "If you like X, you'll love the new Y"
- Personalization > points
- Need to know people's preferences first though...
