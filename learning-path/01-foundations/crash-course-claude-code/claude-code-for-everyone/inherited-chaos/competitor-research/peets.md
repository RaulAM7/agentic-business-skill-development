# Competitor Research: Peet's Coffee

## Program Overview
**Name:** Peetnik Rewards
**Approach:** Quality-focused, coffee purist positioning
**Target:** Serious coffee lovers

## How It Works
- Sign up bonus: Free beverage
- 1 point per $1 spent
- 125 points = Free handcrafted beverage
- Birthday reward
- Members-only offers

## What They Do Well

### 1. Quality Positioning
- Emphasizes coffee expertise
- "Freshly roasted" messaging
- Coffee education content
- Appeals to coffee snobs (respectfully)

### 2. Clean, Simple Structure
- Easy to understand
- No confusing tiers
- Clear value proposition
- Free drink on sign-up (immediate gratification)

### 3. Subscription Integration
- Coffee subscription + rewards work together
- At-home customers stay connected to brand
- Multiple touchpoints

## Their Weaknesses
- Not particularly exciting or memorable
- No gamification
- Basic personalization
- Doesn't create community
- Program feels like an afterthought

## What We Can Learn
- Free drink on sign-up drives registrations
- Coffee expertise can be a differentiator
- Simple is better than confusing
- But simple without personality is forgettable

## Key Stats
- Smaller footprint than Starbucks (~200 locations)
- Strong in Bay Area/West Coast
- Loyal but niche customer base
- Subscription program is their real loyalty driver

## The Big Takeaway
Peet's shows that quality positioning works for a certain customer, but their rewards program isn't driving behavior - it's just "there." They're relying on coffee quality, not program engagement.

If your program is just "buy 10, get 1 free" with extra steps, you're not creating loyalty - you're creating a coupon system.
