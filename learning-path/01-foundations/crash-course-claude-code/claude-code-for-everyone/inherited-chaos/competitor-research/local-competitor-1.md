# Competitor Research: Evergreen Coffee Co.

## Overview
**Type:** Local Portland chain (8 locations)
**Positioning:** Eco-focused, sustainability-first
**Our Overlap:** Same neighborhoods, similar price point

## Their Loyalty Program
**Name:** Green Bean Rewards
**Approach:** Sustainability-tied rewards

### How It Works
- Bring your own cup = bonus points
- Bike/walk to store = bonus points
- Rewards include tree plantings
- "Carbon neutral coffee" option

### What They Do Well
1. **Clear Identity** - Everything ties to sustainability
2. **Values Alignment** - Attracts their target customer
3. **Social Good** - Rewards that feel meaningful
4. **Differentiation** - Can't confuse them with anyone else

### Their Weaknesses
- Alienates non-eco customers
- Can feel preachy
- Limited reward options
- Niche positioning limits growth

## What We Can Learn
- Having a POINT OF VIEW matters
- Rewards can align with values, not just transactions
- Identity attracts identity (their customers WANT to be "green coffee people")
- But being too narrow limits you

## The Big Question
What's OUR point of view? "Community" is nice but vague. Evergreen owns "sustainable." Starbucks owns "convenient." Dutch Bros owns "fun."

What do we own?
