## Program Overview
**Name:** Dutch Rewards
**Approach:** Relationship-first, rewards second
**Vibe:** High-energy, personal connection

## How It Works
- Points per purchase
- Free drink rewards

## Their Weaknesses
- Drive-thru only limits experience
- Rewards program itself is basic
- Not for the "serious coffee" crowd
- Can feel too intense for some

## What We Can Learn
- Personal connection beats points
- Create identity markers (their stickers, our...?)
- Insider knowledge creates belonging
- Community involvement matters
- Energy and enthusiasm are contagious

## Key Insight
Dutch Bros doesn't win on rewards - they win on RELATIONSHIP. Their baristas remember you. Their stickers let you show you belong. The coffee is almost secondary to the experience.

Quote from their training: "We're not in the coffee business serving people. We're in the people business serving coffee."

## The Big Takeaway
You can build loyalty without a sophisticated rewards program if you nail the human connection. Dutch Bros proves that belonging and identity matter more than points.

What's our version of "the sticker"? What makes someone proudly say "I'm a Basecamp person"?
