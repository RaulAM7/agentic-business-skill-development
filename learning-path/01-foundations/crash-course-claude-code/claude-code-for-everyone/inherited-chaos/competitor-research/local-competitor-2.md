# Competitor Research: Roast & Co.

## Overview
**Type:** Seattle indie chain (5 locations)
**Positioning:** Craft/artisan, "third wave" coffee
**Our Overlap:** Downtown and Capitol Hill

## Their Loyalty Program
**Name:** Don't have one
**Approach:** "We're too cool for loyalty programs"

## What They Do Instead

### 1. Punch Cards
- Old school paper punch cards
- 10 drinks = 1 free
- Customers seem to love the simplicity
- Some collect completed cards as "trophies"

### 2. Barista Knowledge
- All baristas trained as coffee experts
- They remember your order
- Personal recommendations
- Make you feel like a coffee insider

### 3. Limited Releases
- Special single-origin drops
- Email list for "first access"
- Creates FOMO and exclusivity
- Customers feel like insiders

### 4. Coffee Classes
- Free monthly tastings
- "Learn to taste like a roaster"
- Builds community organically
- Customers become evangelists

## What We Can Learn
- You don't NEED an app to build loyalty
- Knowledge and expertise create belonging
- Exclusivity can be a feature
- Sometimes simpler is better
- In-person connection matters

## Their Weaknesses
- No data on customers
- Can't scale personalization
- Miss out on digital engagement
- No way to reach inactive customers

## The Big Question
Roast & Co. proves you can build fanatical loyalty without a digital program - through expertise, exclusivity, and personal connection.

But they're limited to 5 locations because they can't scale the human touch.

Can we get the best of both worlds? Digital scale + authentic personality?

## Interesting Quote I Overheard
A customer at Roast & Co. said: "I love that they know I'm an 'Ethiopian natural' person. Makes me feel like they get me."

What if WE helped people discover what kind of coffee person they are?
