# Sub-Agent Feedback on Loyalty Program Synthesis

Three perspectives on the customer feedback and the path forward.

## (ಠ_ಠ) Exec: Leadership Perspective

**The Core Problem:** We've built a generic loyalty program that feels like it came out of a software template. The data shows what matters: Basecamp brand NPS is 67 (solid), but our Rewards program NPS is 12 (disaster). Customers love our coffee and baristas—they just don't care about the program. The trend is worse than stagnation; it's actively eroding. Satisfaction dropped from 46% to 34% in four months while neutrality climbed to 48%. That's not noise—that's a failing initiative.

**What the metrics tell me:** We're throwing $40K at a treadmill people don't want to run on. The tier system is confusing waste. Points feel meaningless. But here's the buried lede in this data: customers are explicitly asking for personalization and identity. They want to feel *known*, not transacted. That's fixable—and it's not a bigger budget problem, it's an execution problem.

**My recommendation:** Stop spending money and start redesigning. Immediate wins first: kill the tier confusion, fix the broken birthday rewards (quick IT fix), clean up the tone-deaf automated communications. Then—and this is the play—implement the coffee personality quiz as the centerpiece. It's cheap, it solves identity, it enables personalization, and it threads the needle between what customers want and what our baristas are already observing. Three-month success looks like this: Rewards NPS back above 40, monthly active users up 25%, redemption rates pushing 15%, and repeat visit frequency trending up. If we see those numbers, we've got something. If not, we've learned a $40K lesson about what doesn't work.

**What does the data say?** It says we don't need more features. We need *personality*.

## (◠‿◠) Product Designer: UX/Experience Perspective

**The Emotional Problem: Invisibility**

The real heartbreak in this data isn't anger - it's *indifference*. Basecamp Coffee has a brand with soul. People walk in and feel something. The coffee tastes like care. The baristas know their names. And then the loyalty program? It's like walking into a beautifully designed café and being handed a generic spreadsheet. It's the emotional whiplash that kills engagement. Customers are saying "Your coffee has personality. Your rewards program doesn't" - and that's not a technical complaint, that's a betrayal. They're comparing the program against the *brand experience* they love and finding it hollow. The program doesn't make them feel like insiders or adventurers or part of something special. It makes them feel like transaction IDs. The 41% neutral baseline that keeps creeping toward 48% isn't apathy - it's *resignation*. People have given up expecting the program to be interesting.

**Why the Connection Is Missing**

Here's what I notice: the current program treats loyalty as a math problem (points, tiers, rewards) when customers are actually asking for an identity problem. Nobody cares about their "Trailblazer" tier because that name has nothing to do with who they are or why they love Basecamp. The Coffee Personality Quiz concept in the recommendations - that's exactly right, but it needs to go deeper. It shouldn't just recommend drinks; it should *introduce* customers to themselves through the lens of coffee. It should create a moment where someone thinks "Oh, that's me. I'm a person who loves bold espresso shots and isn't afraid of bitter" - and suddenly the program feels like it *sees* them. Right now, the program is a points tracker. It needs to be a mirror.

**My Recommendation: Make It About Story, Not Scorekeeping**

Kill the generic tier system and replace it with something that reflects actual Basecamp personality. But here's the emotional design part: don't just rename the tiers. Make membership itself feel like an insider identity. Use the quiz to create genuine segments that feel like tribes or personas - not based on spending, but on what people actually love about coffee and Basecamp. Then build the entire experience around *feeling known*. Personalized drink discoveries, surprise rewards that hit at the exact moment someone needs a pick-me-up, barista recommendations that reference previous orders. Make customers feel like Basecamp remembers them because Basecamp *cares* about them. The engagement gap between the brand (NPS 67) and the program (NPS 12) is telling you that the program is actually *damaging* the relationship. Fix that by making the program an extension of the brand warmth, not a friction point. **Where's the delight?** Right now there isn't any. But there could be.

## (•‿•) Barista Lead: Ground-Level Operations Perspective

**What Customers Really Ask**

Here's what I'm actually seeing behind the counter every single day. Customers ask us: "What coffee should I try?" Not "How many points do I have?" Not "What tier am I?" They want help finding THEIR drink. I had a regular last week - been coming in for three years - ask me if she could talk to someone about what drinks might match her taste. That's what people actually want. The feedback nails it: customers are begging for personalization, and we're offering them a generic points treadmill that could belong to Starbucks, Dutch Bros, or anybody else. That doesn't feel like Basecamp at all.

**What Doesn't Feel Authentic**

Everything about the tier system. "Trailblazer"? "Explorer"? Our baristas can't explain them because they don't mean anything. Customers ask us what their tier is, and we literally can't help them because the app is confusing. That's not just broken - that's embarrassing. And when someone brings up the rewards program, nobody gets excited. Compare that to when we announce a seasonal drink or a new single-origin espresso - people light up. They start asking questions. They come back. The program is inauthentic because it doesn't reflect what Basecamp actually is: a place where coffee has personality and baristas know you.

**Here's My Recommendation**

Kill the generic tier system, and build something around what actually gets customers excited - discovery and personalization. That Coffee Personality Quiz idea in the "Big Bet" section? That's the move. It's something Basecamp-specific. It gives people a reason to engage with the app because they're actually learning something about themselves, not just watching a points meter. Then empower us - the baristas. When someone takes that quiz, we can actually help them find their drink instead of just scanning a card. That's why we got into this in the first place. Customers would actually care about a program that helps us do what we're already doing best: connecting people to coffee that matters to them.

## The Convergence

Three very different perspectives. One clear signal.

Every advisor—the numbers person, the designer, the barista on the floor—sees the same solution path: move away from generic points-and-tiers, move toward identity and personalization, and make the Coffee Personality Quiz the centerpiece.

This is how you know an idea has real legs.
