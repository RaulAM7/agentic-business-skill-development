# Your Situation

## The Company: Basecamp Coffee

Basecamp Coffee is a regional coffee chain with **45 locations** across the Pacific Northwest (Seattle, Portland, Boise, and surrounding areas). Founded in 2015, the company has built a loyal following by focusing on:

- Locally-roasted, ethically-sourced beans
- Community gathering spaces (not just grab-and-go)
- Supporting local artists and events
- A warm, authentic vibe (think: the local shop that knows your name)

The company is profitable but growth has slowed. Leadership is looking for ways to deepen customer relationships and increase visit frequency.

## The Loyalty Program

Six months ago, leadership launched **Basecamp Rewards** - a points-based loyalty program. The hope was to:

1. Increase visit frequency (from 2x/week to 3x/week for regulars)
2. Capture customer data for personalized marketing
3. Compete with Starbucks Rewards and Dutch Bros loyalty programs
4. Turn casual visitors into committed regulars

**The problem:** The program isn't working as expected.

## Your Role

You're the **new manager** at Basecamp Coffee. You were hired to bring fresh energy to the company and tackle some of the problems that have been piling up. You've got a lot on your plate - operations, team management, customer experience - but one urgent priority keeps coming up: the failing loyalty program.

The previous manager left things in a mess. Among the chaos you inherited:
- A folder full of messy notes, half-finished campaign ideas, and scattered data
- A loyalty program with okay sign-up numbers but terrible engagement
- Leadership who's skeptical ("We've invested $40K in this - where are the results?")
- A deadline: **3 months to turn the loyalty program around, or leadership is considering killing it**

## The Stakes

If the program fails:
- $40K investment wasted
- Customer data goes unused
- Competitive disadvantage vs. Starbucks/Dutch Bros
- Your reputation takes a hit (you didn't create the problem, but you own it now)

If you can turn it around:
- Prove yourself as someone who can take on tough problems
- Build something that actually helps the business
- Potentially expand your role

## Your Goal

Over the next few hours, you're going to use Claude Code to:

1. **Make sense of the chaos** - Analyze what you inherited
2. **Understand the problems** - What's actually going wrong?
3. **Find solutions** - What do successful programs do differently?
4. **Build something** - Create a prototype that could save the program

By the end, you'll have real skills AND a real deliverable.

Let's get started.
