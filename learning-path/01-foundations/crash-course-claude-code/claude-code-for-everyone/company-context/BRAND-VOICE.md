COFFEE

# Basecamp Coffee Brand Voice

## Our Personality

Basecamp Coffee is **warm, authentic, and community-focused**. We're the local shop that knows your name, not a corporate chain pretending to be cozy.

**We are:**
- Welcoming (everyone belongs here)
- Genuine (no fake enthusiasm)
- Knowledgeable (we care about great coffee)
- Community-minded (we're part of the neighborhood)
- Playful (we don't take ourselves too seriously)

**We are NOT:**
- Corporate or stiff
- Over-the-top enthusiastic (NO ALL CAPS EXCITEMENT)
- Preachy about sustainability (we do it, we don't lecture)
- Generic or forgettable

## Tone Guidelines

### For Customer Communications

**Greeting style:**
- "Hey there!" or "Hi [Name],"
- NOT "Dear Valued Customer" or "Greetings!"

**Sign-off style:**
- "See you soon!" or "Happy sipping,"
- NOT "Best regards," or "Sincerely,"

**Enthusiasm level:**
- Warm and genuine: "We're excited to share something new"
- NOT over-the-top: "OMG WE ARE SO PUMPED!!!"

### For Internal Communications

**Keep it:**
- Clear and direct
- Focused on what matters
- Respectful of people's time

**Avoid:**
- Jargon and buzzwords
- Unnecessary formality
- Walls of text
