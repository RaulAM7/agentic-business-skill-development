# Basecamp Coffee - Action Items & Key Insights
*Extracted from previous manager (Marcus) handoff notes*

---

## Urgent Action Items

1. **Q3 Report for Dana** - Due end of month. Find the template Dana sent (check email archives)
2. **Fix push notifications** - Broken again. IT ticket #4521 is open
3. **Call app redesign vendor** - Get the quote for the app redesign
4. **Birthday rewards broken** - Not sending automatically. Talk to Jennifer about the manual workaround

## People to Connect With

| Person | Role | Why |
|--------|------|-----|
| Dana | Your boss | Generally supportive, under pressure from leadership |
| Jennifer | Ops | Knows where everything is - go-to for institutional knowledge |
| Priya | Analytics | Can pull any data you need |
| Marcus Jr. | Barista (downtown) | Great customer perspective from the front lines |

## Key Insights About the Program

- People sign up **only because a barista asks them to** - not because they want to
- They download the app once and **forget about it**
- Points don't motivate anyone **until they're close to a reward**
- The tier names (Trailblazer, Explorer) **don't resonate** - nobody cares
- Customer feedback summary: **"fine but forgettable"** - not bad, not good
- The CFO wants ROI numbers - previous manager never figured out how to calculate it

## Past Campaign Performance

- **Double points campaign** - worked okay
- **Social sharing campaign** - disaster
- ~10 unfinished campaign ideas in `old-campaigns/` folder - worth reviewing

## Interesting Idea Worth Exploring

> "What if we helped people find their **coffee personality**? Like a quiz or something. 'Are you a bold espresso person or a smooth latte person?' Could be fun."

Marcus mentioned this twice - once in his notes and again in a P.S. It clearly stuck with him. Could be worth exploring.

## Access & Logistics

- Marketing dashboard: ask IT for access
- Social accounts: shared password doc
