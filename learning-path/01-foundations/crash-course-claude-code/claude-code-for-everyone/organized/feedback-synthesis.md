# Customer Feedback Synthesis: January - April
*Patterns across 4 months and 178 survey responses*

---

## The Headline

**"Fine but forgettable."** This exact phrase appeared across three different months of feedback. It perfectly captures the problem: people don't hate the loyalty program - they just don't care about it.

---

## Key Themes

### 1. Apathy, Not Anger
Satisfaction isn't terrible - but "Neutral" is consistently the #1 response (41% → 44% → 47% → 48%). The trend is slowly getting *worse*. People aren't leaving because of the program, but they're not staying because of it either.

### 2. Zero Identity
Customers repeatedly say the program feels **generic** - "could be any coffee chain." The NPS tells the story: Basecamp overall scores a strong 67, but Basecamp Rewards scores a dismal 12. People love the *brand* but feel nothing about the *program*.

### 3. The Tier System Is Meaningless
Nobody understands or cares about the tiers. "Trailblazer? Explorer? What does that even mean?" Baristas can't explain them. Customers don't know what tier they're in. The tiers add complexity without adding value.

### 4. Points Feel Like a Treadmill
"Takes forever to earn a free drink." "Points don't motivate anyone until they're close to a reward." The earning structure doesn't create excitement or momentum.

### 5. People Want Personalization, Not Transactions
This is the most telling theme. Customers want to feel *known*:
- "I wish you could help me find new drinks to try"
- "The app treats me like a stranger after 2 years"
- "I don't feel like a valued customer, I feel like a transaction"
- "Your coffee has personality. Your rewards program doesn't."

### 6. Competitors Set the Bar
Starbucks gets mentioned for gamification and games. Dutch Bros gets mentioned for personal connection. Basecamp does neither - stuck in an uninspiring middle ground.

## The Trend (January → April)

| Metric | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Very Satisfied + Satisfied | 46% | 41% | 37% | 34% |
| Neutral | 41% | 44% | 47% | 48% |
| Dissatisfied | 13% | 15% | 16% | 18% |
| Survey Responses | 47 | 52 | 38 | 41 |

Satisfaction is slowly eroding. Not a cliff - a slow fade. Which is almost worse, because nobody notices until it's too late.

---

## Bright Spots

- People genuinely love Basecamp's coffee and baristas
- Baristas notice that customers light up when asked about coffee preferences
- Seasonal drinks generate more excitement than the entire rewards program
- The brand has real personality - the program just doesn't reflect it

---

## The Core Problem (In One Sentence)

Basecamp Coffee has a brand people love and a loyalty program that could belong to anyone.

## Next Steps Recommended

### Immediate (Week 1-2)
1. **Kill or simplify the tier system** - It's creating confusion without value. Either remove tiers entirely or redesign them with names and benefits that actually mean something to customers.
2. **Fix the broken birthday rewards** - Quick win. Automated birthday rewards are table stakes and currently broken (IT ticket pending with Jennifer).
3. **Audit all automated communications** - Customers say emails feel "generic" and push notifications fire at 6am. Clean up the messaging cadence and tone.

### Short-Term (Month 1)
4. **Inject brand personality into the program** - Rebrand the rewards experience to feel like *Basecamp*, not like corporate software. Use the brand voice guide. Every touchpoint should feel warm and adventurous.
5. **Rethink the points-to-reward ratio** - The current structure feels like a treadmill. Shorten the path to the first reward so new members get a quick win early.
6. **Add a personalization layer** - Customers are *begging* for this. Start capturing coffee preferences and use them. Even simple things like "try this drink based on what you usually order" would be a leap forward.

### Strategic (Month 1-3)
7. **Explore the Coffee Personality Quiz concept** - Multiple signals point here: Marcus's recurring idea, customers wanting drink discovery, baristas noticing people light up when asked about preferences. A quiz could solve identity, personalization, and engagement in one move.
8. **Introduce gamification elements** - Starbucks sets the bar with challenges and games. Consider seasonal challenges, streak rewards, or surprise-and-delight moments that keep people coming back to the app.
9. **Leverage barista relationships** - Dutch Bros wins on personal connection. Empower baristas to be part of the loyalty experience, not just the people who remind customers to scan.
10. **Set clear success metrics** - Define what "turned around" looks like: target NPS for Rewards, monthly active app users, redemption rates, and repeat visit frequency. Get Priya to build a dashboard.

### The Big Bet
The feedback is loud and clear: people want the program to feel like Basecamp, and they want to feel *known*. The coffee personality quiz idea threads both needles - it gives the program an identity tied to the brand AND creates a foundation for personalized experiences. This should be the centerpiece of the turnaround strategy.
