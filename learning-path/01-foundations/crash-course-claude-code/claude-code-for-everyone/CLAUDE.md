# Basecamp Coffee - Coffee Personality Quiz Project

## Brand Voice (Always Apply)

**Personality:** Warm, authentic, community-focused. The local shop that knows your name.

**Quiz tone:**
- Playful but not silly: "Let's find your coffee personality" NOT "OMG take this QUIZ!!!"
- Genuine curiosity: "Do you prefer bold or smooth?" NOT "Are you ADVENTUROUS or BORING?"
- Coffee-knowledgeable: Reference real flavor profiles, not stereotypes

**Result presentation:**
- Affirming: "You're a Bold Adventurer - you love trying new roasts"
- Specific: "Your profile: medium-dark roasts, fruity notes, pour-over brewing"
- Actionable: "Try this: Our new Kenyan single-origin"

**Marketing copy:**
- In-store signage: "Discover your coffee personality" (simple, inviting)
- Barista talking point: "Have you taken our coffee personality quiz yet? Takes 2 minutes and helps us recommend drinks you'll love"
- Email subject: "What's your coffee personality?" (question format, genuine curiosity)

**What to avoid:**
- Corporate jargon: "Leverage your profile to optimize your beverage experience"
- Fake enthusiasm: "YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS QUIZ!!!!"
- Over-complexity: Long explanations, academic language
- Generic corporate: "Dear Valued Customer"

## Kill Criteria (Pivot Triggers)

If ANY of these thresholds are breached, the program strategy must be reassessed:

- Quiz completion below 40% by Week 4 → poor value proposition
- 30-day retention below 35% by Week 8 → personality doesn't create stickiness
- Cost per completion above $8 by Week 6 → unit economics broken
- No improvement in member CLV by Week 12 → fundamental program problem

## Decision Hierarchy

1. **Dana (Boss):** Final approval on pivots, budget allocation
2. **Leadership Team:** Financial viability gatekeepers
3. **Baristas:** Primary execution channel
4. **Customers:** Feedback loop, success validators

## How Claude Should Work on This Project

When contributing to Basecamp Coffee initiatives, always:

- **Prioritize metrics and business outcomes** over feature completeness
- **Flag budget/timeline risks early** before they compound
- **Reference specific campaign failures and customer feedback** (proof over theory)
- **Maintain warm, authentic brand voice** in all copy and communications
- **Think in unit economics** (cost per completion, CLV, payback period)
- **Call out kill criteria** when metrics approach thresholds

## Full Project Context

For complete briefing including financial details, execution timeline, stakeholder analysis, and competitive positioning, see `@docs/PROJECT_BRIEFING.md`.

This is not a loyalty program fix. This is a program redesign based on explicit customer need, competitive gap, and salvageable insights from 10 failed campaigns all pointing in the same direction.
