# Phase 1: Foundations

Onboarding into the agentic ecosystem. Formation and training materials only.

This folder contains crash courses and mini-projects. The purpose is to build familiarity with the tools, concepts, and patterns before building reusable systems.

## Structure

**crash-course-claude-code/** — Learn Claude Code, the agentic CLI. Covers tool use, file operations, agent patterns, and task orchestration.

**crash-course-antigravity/** — Learn Antigravity, concurrent agent orchestration patterns and coordination.

**mini-projects/** — Guided exercises combining crash course learnings. Build small, focused systems.

## Important

The **global system** (agents/, prompts/, skills/) lives at the repository root.

Do not create operational tooling here. This phase is for learning and formation only. Extract useful patterns and implementations to the root-level directories once they are mature.

Work through the crash courses sequentially. Use mini-projects to practice and cement knowledge.
