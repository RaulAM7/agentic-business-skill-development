## Quick Start

1. Navigate to this directory:
   ```bash
   cd learning-path/01-foundations/mini-projects/Hormozi-Team-Project-v1/

2. Invoke the agent:
   ```
   /agent hormozi-main-agent
   ```

3. Ask strategic questions about:
   - Offer creation and value stacking
   - Lead generation and traffic sources
   - Funnel architecture and optimization
   - Product validation and market signals

## Structure
