# outputs/drafts/

In-progress deliverables. Files here are not accepted yet.

## What goes here

- Any output generated by Claude, Codex, Antigravity, or a sub-agent that has not been reviewed and approved
- Intermediate versions of documents during iterative refinement
- Exploratory outputs (alternative framings, rough outlines, first drafts)

## Naming convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD_[descriptor]_v[N].md
```

Examples:
- `2026-02-21_proposal-yanira_v1.md`
- `2026-02-21_context-synthesis_v1.md`
- `2026-02-22_proposal-yanira_v2.md`

Use `v1`, `v2`, etc. for revisions of the same document. When a draft is accepted, move it to `outputs/final/` (do not copy — move and delete the draft version).

## Lifecycle

```
Generated → outputs/drafts/ → reviewed → outputs/final/
                              ↓ rejected
                           iterate (new version in drafts/)
```

## Rules

- Do not treat drafts as canonical reference — they may be superseded
- Do not link to draft files from PROGRESS.md or SPECS.md (link to final/ only)
- Do not commit partial drafts unless the session needs to be preserved across machines
