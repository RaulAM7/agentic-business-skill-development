# Learning Path

Structured learning phases organized from foundational concepts to advanced patterns.

Each phase (01, 02, 03, 04) contains exercises, problems, and guided implementations. Work through them sequentially.

Outputs from learning-path exercises go to `agents/`, `prompts/`, and `skills/` directories for reuse.

Do not create course content here directly; this is for implementations, exercises, and learning materials that feed into the reusable outputs.
